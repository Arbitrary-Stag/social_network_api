## Description
This is the fourteenth challenge of the UC Berkeley Web Development bootcamp in which we were challenged to build a Social Network API in which users can create acccounts, add friends, post thoughts, and react(comment) to other users thoughts. The point of this challenge was not to build a fully functional app, but to effectively build an api server with functional routes and controllers.

## Installation 
To use this app you must have node installed as well as the packages "Inquirer" and "Mongoose." For this assignment I specifically used the 8.2.4 version of Inquirer. 

## Usage
To launch the app, you need to navigate to the folder containing the code and in your terminal type "npm run start"
This will allow the app to connect to the mongodb server. Then in a api testing program such as Postman or Insomnia, you can build specific api calls using the routes as described in the routes folder to execute specific functions. There will be a video demonstration linked below.
